# pdftodolist
Project to maintain a TODO list and generate PDF checklists

This project allows pretty printed PDFs of to do lists. It's aimed at people, like me who prefer to have a physical 
list they can cross items off. The important part of the project is to generate the PDF and to track completed items. The
backend database is simply to support this. As such the schema is very basic. It may change to an existing issue tracking 
system back-end in future.
